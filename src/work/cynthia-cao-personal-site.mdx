### Description

Client-provided design on a rush job to be completed in 3 days. The design required a custom photo wall and a custom audio player. My development partner and I worked on it together to make sure it was completed on time with top notch performance and responsiveness across all devices. He took care of the custom audio player and photowall while I worked on styling, responsiveness, and animations. Gatsby made sure the site loads quickly and handled optimization of images. The client expressed their full satisfaction upon delivery.
