### Description

I designed and developed this website to replace my previous music landing page with the intention of making my music more interactive and enjoyable to listen to. So I built an audio visualizer, loaded it up with stems of one of my songs, and let the user mute/unmute each stem to control the visualization. It turned out well, and I'm excited to build more scenes with more songs.
