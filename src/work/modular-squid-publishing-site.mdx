### Description

Modular Squid is a new publishing & e-commerce site built headlessly with Prismic.io and Shopify. It was designed to have a unique look and feel, hearkening back to underground e-zines from the late 2000's with some modern flair.

Using Next.js, the majority of the website is statically generated to reduce page loadtimes.
