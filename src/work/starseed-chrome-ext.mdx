### Description

Client-provided design for two rush jobs on tech demos of a web extension product needed for fundraising. The product mints crypto tokens based on engagement between musicians and fans on YouTube. The first extension was fan-facing and tested minting tokens based on time spent watching artist's videos. This demo extension was required to be completed in about 10 hours. PHWEW. The second extension was artist-facing and showed dummy-metrics for how their fans were engaging. This one was completed in 5 days. My development partner and I worked tirelessly to make sure the data was animated realistically and the background scripts interacted properly with YouTube.
