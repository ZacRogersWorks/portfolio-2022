# Zac Rogers Portfolio

## About
I wanted to create a unique portfolio to push myself and show my skills and creativity using ThreeJS (react-three-fiber). I designed this site to be simple and easy to read while making it stand out visually. The intention was to create a calming, inviting atmosphere a user can feel at peace in.  
The site offers a persisting dark and light theme using a toggle switch, responsively adjusts the 3D models position and size, smooth transitions when navigating, and dynamically changing gradient backgrounds.

## Tech Stack
**React** - my preferred framework (library)  
**GatsbyJS** - for SSG, SEO, image optimization, and dynamic Project pages  
**SCSS** - for styling organization and easier dark mode implementation  
**React-Three-Fiber/ThreeJS/DREI** - for the wow factor  
**Framer-Motion** - for animations and page transitions  
**Netlify** - for easy Gatsby deployment
